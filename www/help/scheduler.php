		The Year, Month, and Day fields are optional on the First and Last Run Dates.  These fields may be filled with zeros to ignore that portion of the date such as '0000-02-14' to run a playlist every Valentine's day or '0000-00-03' to run a playlist on the third of every month.  The 'days' field is still in effect during the date range.
